# Huffman-Algorithm
CSCI-220 final project implementing Huffman's algorithm using a min-priority queue. <br>
Once the tree has been built, the program should: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.) encode a sequence of characters into a string of 1's and 0's <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.) decode a string of 1's and 0's into a sequence of characters
